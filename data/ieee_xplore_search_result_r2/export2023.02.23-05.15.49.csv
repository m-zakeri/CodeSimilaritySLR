We aim at fostering the exchange of ideas that will help exploring, understanding, and modeling the software quality phenomena based on evidence. Evidence-based Software Quality Engineering combines evidence based approaches with the engineering of software quality technologies. It aims at the evolution of the field, by strengthening the confidence on such technologies resulted from the research and development initiatives. The building blocks of evidence-based approaches are primary studies, which can range from observational studies to controlled experiments, either applying quantitative or qualitative techniques. In this edition two primary studies using evidence based approaches are presented.","","978-1-5090-3581-6","10.1109/QUATIC.2016.042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814539","","","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clones are known to be closely related to various issues on software engineering, such as software quality, complexity, architecture, refactoring, evolution, licensing, plagiarism, and so on. Various characteristics of software systems can be uncovered through the clone analysis, and system restructuring can be performed by merging clones. The purpose of this workshop is to continue to solidify and give shape to this research/application area and community. More specifically, the goals are to bring together academic and industrial researchers and practitioners from around the world to evaluate the current state of research and applications, discuss common problems, discover new opportunities for collaboration, exchange ideas, and envision new areas of research and applications. In this, the 6th international clone workshop, we will discuss issues in software clone detection, analysis and management, as well as applications to software engineering contexts that can benefit from knowledge of clones. As befits a maturing workshop, we have this year added independent program committee chairs to oversee the technical program.","","978-1-4673-1795-5","10.1109/IWSC.2012.6227859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227859","","","","","","1","","","IEEE","2 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying such code automatically could be of great help during maintenance of the system. First of all, it allows a developer to more easily find the places in the code that must be changed when the concern changes and, thus, makes such changes less time consuming and less prone to errors. Second, it allows the code to be refactored to an aspect-oriented solution, thereby improving its modularity. In this paper, we evaluate the suitability of clone detection as a technique for the identification of crosscutting concerns. To that end, we manually identify five specific crosscutting concerns in an industrial C system and analyze to what extent clone detection is capable of finding them. We consider our results as a stepping stone toward an automated ""aspect miner” based on clone detection.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2005.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542063","Index Terms- Clone detection;reverse engineering;aspect-oriented programming;crosscutting concerns;aspect mining.","Software maintenance;Conferences;Computer science;Software engineering;Software algorithms;Programming;Cloning;Software systems;Costs;Humans","","Index Terms- Clone detection;reverse engineering;aspect-oriented programming;crosscutting concerns;aspect mining.","","1","","","IEEE","21 Nov 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this talk, we will brief y review the WCRE 2000 work and discuss the advances in the field. The WCRE 2000 paper presented a computer assisted clone re-factoring approach. The process was based on metric-based clone analysis that produced clone clusters. Clones in the same cluster were then compared using token-based dynamic programming (DP) matching. Token-based clone differences, which included insertions, deletions, and substitutions, were then projected on to the ASTs corresponding to clones. Re-factoring opportunities were evaluated using: (1) classification of differences involving superficial differences, signature changes, and type changes, (2) number of differences, and (3) size of candidate clones. Selected clones were automatically re-factored using “strategy” and “template” design patterns. Experimental evaluation was performed on JDK1.1.5 from Sun Microsystems. Significant work followed over the next years addressing problems that include matching algorithms, scalability, and integration of clone detection in software engineering activities such as maintenance, evolution, and re-factoring. Several interesting surveys can be found in the literature together with a list of problems, many of which remain open today. In particular, recent work on software clones included new approaches to clone detection based on prefix and suffix trees, approaches to detection involving source code analysis based on latent semantic analysis, and clone identification techniques using analysis of program dependence graphs. In other works, a canonical representation of clones was developed and used for matching and comparison; interesting discussions about harmfulness of clones have also been reported; and empirical studies and evaluations of clone detection approaches can be found in several research papers. Evolution aspects have been taken into consideration in terms of evolution of clones and their lifetime over several versions of a system and in terms of software evolution by computing various similarity measures between versions. Clone research has also touched upon several interesting applications: intellectual property issues such as license infringement and plagiarism of source code have been addressed using software similarity concepts; incremental approaches to clone detection have been investigated; clones and similarity between structured software artifacts such as trees and graphs has been introduced; detection of bugs caused by inconsistent modifications between clones in a systems and between fragments in several software releases has been investigated; domain specific clones have been studied; and approaches for clone visualization have been proposed. Finally, new specialized workshops and conferences on clones and on mining software repositories have been organized. There are many open problems that remain and possible areas for future work in CLAN (CLone Analysis) toolset including the definition of clones; addressing type III (similar) and simple type IV (semantic) clones; performance and scalability aspects; taxonomies of clones; clone classification and statistics including frequent patterns of similarity in large systems; inconsistent modifications of clones in one version of a system and inconsistent source code changes over several versions of a system leading to a taxonomy of identifiable bugs; clone matching by parallelizing and implementing it on a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU); intellectual property and plagiarism detection using spectral clone analysis; increase recall while maintaining precision; clone maximality issues under thresholds; and more.","2375-5369","978-1-4244-8911-4","10.1109/WCRE.2010.51","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645476","","","dynamic programming;object-oriented methods;software metrics","advanced clone analysis;support object-oriented system refactoring;clone detection;computer assisted clone refactoring;metric-based clone analysis;clone cluster;token-based dynamic programming matching;token-based clone difference;matching algorithm;software engineering;software clone;source code analysis;latent semantic analysis;clone identification;program dependence graphs;software evolution;similarity measure;software similarity concept;structured software artifact;intellectual property;plagiarism detection;spectral clone analysis;clone maximality","","","","","IEEE","29 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
